```

## üîß Technical Stack

### **Core Technologies**
- **LangChain**: Document processing and AI orchestration
- **Qdrant**: Vector database for semantic search
- **OpenAI GPT-3.5**: Natural language processing and generation
- **OpenAI Embeddings**: Text-to-vector conversion
- **PDF-Parse**: PDF text extraction

### **Dependencies Added**
```json
{
  "langchain": "^latest",
  "@langchain/community": "^latest",
  "@langchain/qdrant": "^latest",
  "@langchain/openai": "^latest",
  "@qdrant/js-client-rest": "^latest",
  "pdf-parse": "^latest",
  "openai": "^latest"
}
```

## üöÄ How It Works

### **1. Document Upload Flow**
```
User uploads PDF ‚Üí 
Temporary file creation ‚Üí 
Text extraction with PDFLoader ‚Üí 
Document chunking ‚Üí 
Generate embeddings ‚Üí 
Store in Qdrant ‚Üí 
Cleanup temporary files
```

### **2. Chat Flow**
```
User asks question ‚Üí 
Convert question to embeddings ‚Üí 
Semantic search in Qdrant ‚Üí 
Retrieve relevant chunks ‚Üí 
Generate context-aware response ‚Üí 
Return formatted answer
```

## üé® User Interface Features

### **Upload Section**

## üìã Setup Requirements

### **Environment Variables**
```bash
# Required for Medical Report Analysis
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
QDRANT_URL=http://localhost:6333
```

### **Docker Services**
```bash
# Start Qdrant database
docker-compose -f docker-compose.qdrant.yml up -d

# Or use provided scripts
./start-qdrant.sh    # Linux/Mac
start-qdrant.bat     # Windows
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

### **Data Handling**
- Temporary file storage only
- Automatic file cleanup after processing
- No persistent storage of medical documents
- Local vector database (no external data transfer)

### **API Security**
- Input validation for file uploads
- Error handling to prevent information leakage
- Rate limiting considerations for production

## üß™ Testing Recommendations

### **Manual Testing**
1. Upload various PDF formats
2. Test with different medical report types
3. Ask various types of questions
4. Test error scenarios (invalid files, network issues)
5. Verify file cleanup after processing

### **Example Questions to Test**
- "What are the key findings in this report?"
- "Are there any abnormal values?"
- "Can you explain what these test results mean?"
- "Should I be concerned about anything?"
- "What follow-up actions are recommended?"

## üöÄ Deployment Considerations

### **Production Environment**
1. **Qdrant**: Consider managed Qdrant Cloud or self-hosted cluster
2. **OpenAI**: Monitor API usage and costs
3. **File Storage**: Implement proper temporary file management
4. **Scaling**: Consider load balancing for multiple users
5. **Monitoring**: Add logging and error tracking

### **Performance Optimization**
- Implement caching for frequently asked questions
- Optimize chunk sizes based on content type
- Consider streaming responses for better UX
- Add request rate limiting

## üìà Future Enhancements

### **Potential Features**
- Multi-document chat (compare reports)
- Report summarization
- Trend analysis across multiple reports
