# 🚀 Medical Reports Chat Feature - Ready to Use!

## ✅ What's Been Fixed

I've completely updated and fixed the medical reports feature with:

1. **Better Error Handling**: Detailed error messages and logging
2. **Environment Setup**: Proper API key configuration
3. **Health Checks**: System status verification
4. **Improved UI**: Better user feedback and setup instructions

## 🔧 Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### 1. Start Docker Desktop
Make sure Docker Desktop is running on your system.

### 2. Start Qdrant Database
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.qdrant.yml up -d
```

### 3. Verify Setup
Visit: http://localhost:9002/api/medical-reports/health

Should show:
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "checks": {
    "openai": true,
    "qdrant_connection": true
  },
  "ready": true
}
```

### 4. Test the Feature
1. Go to: http://localhost:9002/medical-reports
2. Upload a PDF medical report
3. Ask questions like:
   - "What are the key findings?"
   - "Are there any abnormal values?"
   - "What do these test results mean?"

## 🎯 What's Different Now

### API Routes (`/api/medical-reports/`)
- **`upload`**: Enhanced PDF processing with better error handling
